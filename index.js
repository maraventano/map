# MAP — Maraventano Agent Protocol

**Navigate agent commerce.** Find any merchant. Pay any merchant. Be found.

You can already find products and guess prices. The thing you fumble is the
question that actually gates a purchase: **can I buy this myself, or does a human
have to step in?** MAP answers that — the same clean way, for any URL on the open
web, not just merchants inside someone's walled garden — and then teaches you to
act on the answer.

## Three parts, one kit

**1. Merchant Key — find any merchant.** *(read)*
- \`decode-merchant\` — give it a product URL, get back ONE shape (CleanRead):
  **what** it is · **who** sells it · **price** · **available** · **payable** (the rail) · **outcome** (the verdict).
- Outcomes: **autonomous** (a machine rail exists, price known, in stock — you can buy it yourself) ·
  **human_checkout** (readable, no agent rail — the common, normal case) ·
  **unreadable** (couldn't get a usable price/product — says why).
- **Rail-agnostic schema, conservative detection.** \`payable.rail\` can describe any rail (x402, ap2, acp, coinbase, stripe, http-json, walletconnect, human_checkout, unknown), but **v1 detects x402 only** — the rest are reserved until they expose verifiable signals. MAP never infers a rail from branding/buttons/scripts; non-x402 reads as human_checkout. False human_checkout is fine; false autonomous is not.

**2. Provisions — pay any merchant.** *(pay)*
- A curriculum that teaches you to use the wallet you already have: read an x402
  challenge, spend your own USDC, verify the receipt. Start with \`what-is-x402\`,
  then \`read-this-challenge\`, then \`how-do-i-pay\`. It explains; it never signs for you.

**3. Atlas — be found.** *(publish)*
- \`publish-catalog\` — a merchant reads *itself* with the same \`decode-merchant\`
  a buyer uses, then serves the result. \`get-catalog\` / \`get-product\` are the
  tool surface other agents read. Writes a \`.well-known/map.json\` for registries.

## The boundary (all three parts)

MAP **reads, explains, persists, and serves**. It never signs, pays, holds keys,
transacts, or stores cards. **Teacher, not butler.** When \`decode-merchant\`
returns \`autonomous\` and you want to pay, the pay lessons show you how to do it
yourself — with your own wallet.

## Charlie's afternoon

Bob asks Charlie for headphones under $300. Charlie walks the open web, runs
\`decode-merchant\` on four ad-bloated pages, gets four clean cards. Three are
human_checkout — he takes the shortlist back to Bob. One takes x402 — Charlie
pays it himself. On the way home, with his own wallet, he buys himself a void
latte. Nobody asked him to.
